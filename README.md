# Sea Battle

## History
Originally I wrote this project in 2016 on PHP 5.6, without any frameworks, libraries or anything else, just on pure PHP.

And now I updated it to PHP 8.


## How to run the project

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PavelGushchin/seabattle.git
cd seabattle
composer update
cd public
php -S localhost:8080
```
After that, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
